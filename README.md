What is this?
---------------

It's a prototype I coded up in like 20 minutes. Seriously, don't use it. 
I only did it to start playing with some kind of architecture for an app 
that might be something like collectd or diamond or something like that 
some day. 

Can I run it? 
---------------

Sure, just clone the repo, cd into the new directory, and run 'python server.py', and 
sit there for a while. Every minute it'll print the output of os.loadavg() to the screen.
